%%%% We have seen that to typeset something in \LaTeX, we type in the
%%%% text to be typeset together with some \LaTeX\ commands.
%%%% Words must be separated by spaces (does not matter how many)
%%%% and lines maybe broken arbitrarily.

%%%% %The end of a paragraph is specified by a blank line in the input. In other words,
%%%% %whenever you want to start a new paragraph, just leave a blank line and proceed. For
%%%% %example, the first two paragraphs above were produced by the input
%%%% 
%%%% %Note that the first line of each paragraph starts with an indentation from the left
%%%% %margin of the text. If you do not want this indentation, just type \noindent at the start
%%%% %of each paragraph

\textbf{A polygon of three sides is called a
\emph{triangle} and a polygon of four sides is called a
\emph{quadrilateral}}




By a \textbf{triangle}, we mean a polygon of three sides.


By a {\bfseries{triangle}}, we mean a polygon of three sides.

By a {\bfseries triangle}, we mean a polygon of three sides.


% Thus to make the declaration act upon a specific piece of text (and no more), the declaration
% and the text should be enclosed in braces.
% Each of these type style changing commands has an alternate form as a declaration. 声明式的  后面的生效
